Jaʿfar; ḥaddathanā Shuʿbah; he said: I heard ʿUbaydah narrating from Ibrāhīm, from Ibn Minjāb, from Qurthaʿ, from Abū Ayyūb (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet ﷺ who said: “Four before Dhuhr; there is no taslīm among them; for them the gates of heaven are opened.”\nAbū Dāwūd said: It reached me from Yaḥyá b. Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān that he said: If I were to narrate anything from ʿUbaydah, I would narrate this ḥadīth from him.\nAbū Dāwūd said: ʿUbaydah is ḍaʿīf (weak).\nAbū Dāwūd said: Ibn Minjāb is Sahm.\nAbū Dāwūd — may Allah have mercy on him — brought the ḥadīth (prophetic report) of Abū Ayyūb (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet ﷺ said: “Four before Dhuhr; there is no taslīm among them; for them the gates of heaven are opened).”\nThis indicates the ṣalāh (prayer) of four before Dhuhr, and that there is no taslīm among them — its meaning is that they are connected, with no taslīm in the middle but rather at the end. However, the aḥādīth have come stating that the ṣalāh is two by two, and the ḥadīth contains this man about whom there is criticism.\nal-Albānī graded this ḥadīth ḥasan (good), and I do not know what the basis of declaring it good is, for the man in the isnād (chain of transmission) is weak and underwent ikhtiṭlāṭ (confusion), and he is ʿUbaydah b. Muʿattib.\nSo if there are shawāhid (supporting narrations) or something relied upon other than this route, then there would be a case for it. And even if the ḥadīth were ṣaḥīḥ (authentic), what is preferable is that the rawātib (regular supererogatory prayers) and the nawāfil (supererogatory prayers) be performed two by two, and it is permissible to perform them as a continuous sequence if the ḥadīth from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is authentic.\nShaykh Nāṣir — may Allah have mercy on him — authenticated the ḥadīth with the wording: “Four rakʿahs (units of prayer) after zawāl (when the sun passes the meridian) before Dhuhr; there is no taslīm between them; they are equivalent to the ṣalāt al-saḥar (pre-dawn prayer).”\nIt is in al-Silsilah al-Ṣaḥīḥah, volume three.\nIf the ḥadīth is authentic, then it is permissible to string them together, though not stringing them together is preferable.\nJust as the night ṣalāh is “two by two,” it is permissible to combine as four on its own, and four on its own, and three on its own, as that has come from the Messenger of Allah—may Allah bless him and grant him peace—so connecting and separating are both permissible, but separating is preferable to connecting.\nAnd if we say connecting them is allowed, then does one perform a middle tashahhud?\nThe answer that appears is that he does not perform it, so that it does not become as though it were Dhuhr; for if a person were to do that, it would be as though he had prayed Dhuhr.",

            "body": "Question: “What is the correct position for working according to the calendar times for the prayers and that which is printed and circulated among many of the people especially in the West? Is it simply according to the entrance of the time specified on the calendar or is it better to wait a little to be on the safe side? We would like from you noble Shaykh some instruction for those in charge on the Masjids. And if differing occurs amongst the people concerning this matter what do you advise them with?”\nAnswer: This requires precise experimenting and testing of these calendars by way of study from the Muslims ‘on the ground’ as they say.\nThey look at the time of Fajr on the calendar to see what hour and minute the calendar says, then they go outside of the city to a place that has no lights and they look for the light of Fajr in real time; as it has been described by the Messenger peace be upon him. If they see that it agrees with the calendar, they affirm it. If it differs then say to the Muslims, this differs from the actual time therefore wait this amount of time.\nThis problem is found in the Muslim countries now; in Morocco and other places; in Algeria and other places unfortunately. The Muslims have become careless with regards to their prayer. Some people have complained that they set the time for Fajr about fifteen minutes before it enters. And Allah knows best.\nWe said to the Salafis; ‘experiment’. Go outside of the cities and look at the time of Fajr in a place that is far from lights. Fajr will become clear to you upon its reality. If it agrees (with the calendar) all praises belong to Allah. We will be relieved from the suspicions, problems and delusions, and confusion of the people. If it does not agree (with the calendar) then we present this to the responsible authority at the ministry. We say to them, we have experimented, and we would like to go out with you all for a second experiment. We found this time while the calendar contradicts the real time. This is my view on issue.",
